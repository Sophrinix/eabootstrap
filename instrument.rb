# SYNOPSIS
#   Instrument hold the series and meta-information about them.
#   
#   Every instrument can be of one out of two types, OHLC or tick. If such
#   instrument if OHLC, then it may have OHLC timestamped series grouped
#   according to the chosen period (1-minute data, 30-minutes data, etc);
#   otherwise, it will contain thin, timestamped ticks.
#
#   A trader have its buying-power limited to a maximum allowed leveraged.
#   If maximum leverage equals X not lower than trader's account leverage,
#   then it is understood that a position size will meet the margin taken /
#   position size ratio of 1:X.
#
#   The pip size is the atomic part of the currency and hence the very least
#   minor motion occurs lower-bounded by pip size. For instance, take EUR
#   which pip size is 0.0001.
#   
#   Moreover, stop level regulates when will occur a margin call. Stop level
#   is a percentage (usually around 50-200%). This indicates a position may
#   meet a margin call (potentially closing position) whenever
#   
#     equity * stop_level < margin.
#
#   Last but not least, freeze level regulates the range that will freeze a
#   position whenever ask/bid prices fall within the aforementioned range.
#   Is means that a take profit, stop loss, or full/partial close orders can
#   NOT be cancelled if TP/SL/close orders fall within
#
#     ask/bid +- freeze_level * pip_size,
#
#   according to the direction of the order (sell/buy).
